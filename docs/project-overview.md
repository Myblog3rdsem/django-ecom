### Project Name

"Quantum Cart" combines the concept of "quantum," which in physics refers to discrete packets of energy or matter, with "cart," which represents the shopping cart in an e-commerce context. 

The name suggests a high-tech or advanced shopping experience, perhaps implying that the platform offers a vast and diverse range of products (like the diversity of quantum states) while also emphasizing efficiency and innovation.
